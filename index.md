# Michigan No-Fault Wiki

## Introduction  

Welcome to the Michigan No-Fault Law Wiki. Please note that this wiki is a work in progress. I will add content regularly and as quickly as time permits, and hope that the wiki develops into a usable and helpful resource sooner rather than later. Important updates--including inevitable changes to the wiki's structure, organization and navigation--will be posted here.  

This wiki is intended to serve as a central repository of litigation forms, analysis, annotations, case law, and other authority addressing issues that commonly arise in connection with the Michigan No-Fault system, especially as it relates to first-party litigation. The wiki's content is organized both topically and by the relevant section(s) of the Michigan No-Fault Act itself. For example, content related to attendant care benefits is accessible either by navigating to the section discussing [MCL §500.3105](MCL 500.3105.md), or by navigating to the [Attendant Care](Attendant Care.md) section itself.  

In addition to ease of navigation, I have attempted to organize the wiki's content to also serve as a helpful outline of No-Fault Act as a whole to assist those who lack a comprehensive understanding of the Michigan no-fault system. I have also attempted to include as many cross references as possible within the wiki to make navigation as painless as possible. 

If you believe a section of the wiki would be better organized or structured in a different manner--or if you would like to contribute content or suggest revisions--please leave a note via the Disqus comment pane located at the bottom of each section. You can also email me at jchurch@secrestwardle.com.
